# Data Science from Scratch
In this repository, I am embarking on an exciting data science and machine learning learning journey by following the insightful guidance of "Data Science from Scratch" by Joel Grus. This book serves as a comprehensive resource to master the foundational principles of data science and machine learning, and it offers a wide range of key features and chapters, including:

-- A swift introduction to Python for beginners.
-- Essential concepts in linear algebra, statistics, and probability, providing a solid foundation for data science applications.
-- Techniques for data collection, exploration, cleaning, and manipulation.
-- Fundamental machine learning concepts and principles.
-- Hands-on implementation of various models, such as k-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, linear and logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, and clustering.
-- Exploring advanced topics like recommender systems, natural language processing, network analysis, MapReduce, and databases.
